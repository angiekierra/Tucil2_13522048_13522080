## General Information
Bézier curve is a smooth curve defined by control points. A Bézier curve is said to have order n if it is defined by n+1 points. This curve has many applications, such as in pen tools, crafting unique fonts, creating smooth and realistic animations, and more.

This project aims to demonstrate the generation of Bézier curves using both the Mid-Point Algorithm and the direct approach involving a formula. Subsequently, algorithm complexity analysis is conducted to determine whether the Mid-Point Algorithm is more efficient for the curve's generation. 


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.11.5


## Features
- Bézier curve generation with Mid-Point Algorithm
- Bézier curve generation with direct formula
- Graphical User Interface for receiving inputs and display results

## Setup
1. Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone the repository using one of the following commands:
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/angiekierra/Tucil1_13522048.git
    ```
    or
    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:angiekierra/Tucil1_13522048.git
    ```


## Usage
To try the program, simply navigate to the src directory by running cd src, then execute python main.py. You will have several options for choosing which algorithm to use and which visualization to display the results.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_


## Room for Improvement
- Enhance the visualization of the Mid-Point Algorithm to display the generation of individual points.
- Integrate the GUI into a single window for better organization and user experience.
- Improve error handling and user feedback to provide a smoother and more robust user experience.
